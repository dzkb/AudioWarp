Audiowarp
---------

Are you playing multiplayer games with voice chat?
Do you have a good time hanging out with your friends on TeamSpeak?
Would you like to record only the best parts of the chat?

Then AudioWarp is a tool for you. It records last few minutes of system audio (configurable) and after a hotkey (WIN+F3) saves the buffer to a single file.

### Todo:
    - recording from more than one audio device
    - easier customization
    - audio compression

### Usage:
Run the script. When you're ready to save, press WIN+F3. If you want to quit, press WIN+ESCAPE.
